The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just *any* memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!

## How The Game Is Played

1. Flip over two hidden cards.
2. If they match, keep flipping. 
3. If not, remember the icons and try to find their twin.

## What The Player Is Expect From The Game

- Be happy - it's just a game, practice makes perfect.
- Be focused - the less moves you make, the less stars you loose.
- Be proud - if you finish the game with three stars, not everyone can do it.

## Game Dependecies

- ★★★ --- < 15 MOVES
- ★★ --- 15 - 20 MOVES 
- ★ --- + 20

## Hint

Haste makes waste.
